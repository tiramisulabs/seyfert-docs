description: An introduction on how to deploy Seyfert in a Docker container
---

This guide assumes you have knowledge of the following topics:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization)

## Why Docker?

Docker provides a consistent environment that ensures the proper functioning of any bot in both development and production, as well as simplifying the integration with CI/CD tools.

With Docker scaling a bot horizontally is simple, allowing workloads to be distributed across multiple instances as needed.

## What files does a Seyfert project require?

- `package.json`
- `seyfert.config.mjs`
- `/node_modules`
- `/src` or `/dist`

## Deploying with Node.js

### Container file for a TypeScript project

A basic container file looks as follows:

```docker title="Dockerfile" copy
FROM node:<VERSION_TAG>

WORKDIR /bot

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install --production

RUN npm i -g typescript

COPY tsconfig.json seyfert.config.mjs ./
COPY /src ./src

# Build typescript files
RUN tsc --project tsconfig.json

ENV NODE_ENV=production

ENTRYPOINT ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

You must replace `<VERSION_TAG>` with the Node.js version you want to use.

### Container file with multi-stage builds

Although the previous container image is simple and practical, it can still be improved by adding multi-stage builds and other best practices:

```docker title="Dockerfile" copy
# [ base ] #
FROM node:<VERSION_TAG>-alpine AS base

ENV DIR /bot
WORKDIR $DIR

# [ OS packages ] #
FROM base AS pkg

RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache dumb-init

# [ project builder ] #
FROM base AS build

COPY package*.json ./

## Ref: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-ci
RUN npm ci
## Ref: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-prune
RUN npm prune --production

RUN npm i -g typescript

COPY tsconfig.json seyfert.config.mjs ./
COPY /src ./src

## Build typescript
RUN tsc --project tsconfig.json

# [ production ready ] #
FROM base AS production

# Joining stages
## Packages
COPY --from=pkg /usr/bin/dumb-init /usr/bin/dumb-init
## Dependencies
COPY --from=build $DIR/node_modules ./node_modules
## Builder
COPY --from=build $DIR/dist ./dist
COPY --from=build $DIR/package.json ./package.json
COPY --from=build $DIR/seyfert.config.js ./seyfert.config.js

# Environment permissions
ENV NODE_ENV production
## Remove if your project needs root permissions
ENV USER node
USER $USER

# Run the application
ENTRYPOINT ["dumb-init", "node", "dist/index.js"]
```
