### Updating Seyfert's Configuration

Before starting this section, you need to update the `seyfert.config.mjs` file to specify the location of the event files for Seyfert.

```ts twoslash {10} title="seyfert.config.mjs" copy wrap
import { config } from 'seyfert';

export default config.bot({
    token: process.env.BOT_TOKEN ?? '',
    intents: ['Guilds'],
    locations: {
        base: 'src',
        output: 'dist',
        commands: 'commands',
        events: 'events' // - src/events will be our folder for events
    }
});
```

## Listening to Events

Each event file must export the `createEvent` function as the default export so Seyfert can load it.  
The `createEvent` function takes an object with two properties: `data` and `run`.

Let's listen to the `botReady` event as the first example:

```ts twoslash title="src/events/botReady.ts" showLineNumbers
import { createEvent } from 'seyfert';

export default createEvent({
// botReady is triggered when all shards and servers are ready.
// `once` ensures the event runs only once.
  data: { once: true, name: 'botReady' },
  run(user, client) {

// @log: We can use client.logger to display messages in the console.
    client.logger.info(`${user.username} is ready`);

  }
})
```

<br />

As a second example, let's look at the `guildDelete` event emitted by Discord when a bot is removed from a server or the server is deleted:

```ts twoslash title="src/events/guildDelete.ts" showLineNumbers wrap
import { createEvent } from 'seyfert';

export default createEvent({
  data: { name: 'guildDelete' },
  run(unguild, client) {
    // unguild is the server from which the bot was removed or deleted.
    // It is also possible that the server was simply deleted.
    if (unguild.unavailable) return;

    client.logger.info(`I was removed from: ${unguild.id}`);
  }
})
```

<br />

After completing these steps, your project structure should look like this:

<FileTree>

- src
	- commands
		- ping.ts
	- events
		- **botReady.ts**
		- **guildDelete.ts**
	- index.ts
- package.json
- seyfert.config.mjs
- tsconfig.json
- .env

</FileTree>
