We have touching on the basics of creating a command, but what if we want to create a command that has sub-commands? For example, we want to create a command that has a `create` and `delete` sub-command. This is where sub-commands come in.

## Creating a Sub-Command

To create a sub-command, we need to create a new class that extends `SubCommand` and implement the `run` method. We then need to add the sub-command to the parent command.

It's suppose you have the following directory structure:

<FileTree>
- src
 - commands
	- account
	 	- create.command.ts
	 	- delete.command.ts
	 	- parent.ts
 - index.ts
- seyfert.config.js
- package.json
- tsconfig.json
</FileTree>

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label='parent.ts' icon="seti:typescript">

:::tip

With this file structure you can use `@Autoload()` and seyfert will add the commands for you.
But make sure you export by default the sub-commands.

:::


	```ts copy
import { type CommandContext, Declare, Command, Options } from "seyfert";
import { CreateCommand } from "./create.command";
import { DeleteCommand } from "./delete.command";

@Declare({
	name: "account",
	description: "account command"
})
// Being in the same folder with @AutoLoad() you can save this
@Options([CreateCommand, DeleteCommand])
export default class AccountCommand extends Command {}

```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label='create.command.ts' icon="seti:typescript">
	
```ts copy
import { type CommandContext, Declare, SubCommand } from "seyfert";

@Declare({
	name: "create",
	description: "create a new something"
})
export class CreateCommand extends SubCommand {
	run(ctx: CommandContext) {
		// some logic there

		ctx.write({
			content: "create command executed"
		});
	}
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label='delete.command.ts' icon="seti:typescript">
```ts copy
import { type CommandContext, Declare, SubCommand } from "seyfert";

@Declare({
	name: "delete",
	description: "delete something"
})
export class DeleteCommand extends SubCommand {
	run(ctx: CommandContext) {
		// some logic here

		ctx.write({
			content: "delete command executed"
		});
	}
}
```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>






In the example above, we have created a `create` and `delete` sub-command. We then added the sub-commands to the parent command using the `@Options` decorator.

:::note
Notice that basically we treat the sub-command as an option of the parent command. (actually this is how discord treats sub-commands as well)
