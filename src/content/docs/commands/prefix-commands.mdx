## Prefix Configuration

Seyfert handles not only application commands but also `prefix commands`. They are not enabled by default, but you can enable them by configuring an option within [`ClientOptions`](https://github.com/tiramisulabs/seyfert/blob/455ed12b0ebcb3ddf55bc8b3274b0ce904becc62/src/client/client.ts#L230). We have access to the `command` option where we can specify a suboption called `prefix`. This option expects a callback that returns an array of possible prefixes for that command. Since the callback returns a [`Message`](https://github.com/tiramisulabs/seyfert/blob/455ed12b0ebcb3ddf55bc8b3274b0ce904becc62/src/structures/Message.ts#L123), we have access to the `command` option where we can specify a suboption called `prefix`. This option expects a callback returning an array of possible prefixes for that command. As the callback returns a [`Message`](https://github.com/tiramisulabs/seyfert/blob/455ed12b0ebcb3ddf55bc8b3274b0ce904becc62/src/structures/Message.ts#L123) property inside [`CommandContext`](https://github.com/tiramisulabs/seyfert/blob/455ed12b0ebcb3ddf55bc8b3274b0ce904becc62/src/commands/applications/chatcontext.ts#L24), it is quite simple to handle different prefixes per server.

Here’s an example where we configure multiple prefixes for all commands.

```ts showLineNumbers copy ins={4-9} wrap

import { Client } from 'seyfert';

const client = new Client({
    commands: {
        prefix: (msg) => {
            // here you can handle whatever prefixes you want depending on the message data.
            return ['!', '?', '.']
        }
    }
});

```

## Handling Prefix Commands

After configuring our prefixes for commands, it's time to make them work.

Fortunately, handling them works the same way as application commands. The only difference is that we receive an optional [`Message`](https://github.com/tiramisulabs/seyfert/blob/455ed12b0ebcb3ddf55bc8b3274b0ce904becc62/src/structures/Message.ts#L123) property inside the [`CommandContext`](https://github.com/tiramisulabs/seyfert/blob/455ed12b0ebcb3ddf55bc8b3274b0ce904becc62/src/commands/applications/chatcontext.ts#L24).

To make this property appear in our CommandContext, all we need to do is declare the Seyfert module and set the `withPrefix` property inside [`InternalOptions`](https://github.com/tiramisulabs/seyfert/blob/455ed12b0ebcb3ddf55bc8b3274b0ce904becc62/src/commands/applications/shared.ts#L11) to true. You can see this [detailed example](/guides/declare-module#internal-options).

In this example, we are going to create a command that `crossposts` the message sent in an announcement channel.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { 
    Command,
    CommandContext,
    Declare
} from 'seyfert';

@Declare({
    name: 'crosspost',
    description: 'Crosspost an announcement message.'
})
export default class CrosspostCommand extends Command {
    async run(ctx: CommandContext){
        if(ctx.message) await ctx.message.crosspost();
        return ctx.write({ content: 'I have crossposted your announcement.'});
    }
};
```

### Ignoring Commands

You can decide whether a command should ignore being a slash command or a text command.

```ts showLineNumbers copy ins={5,11}
import { 
    Command,
    CommandContext,
    Declare,
    IgnoreCommand
} from 'seyfert';

@Declare({
    name: 'crosspost',
    description: 'Crosspost an announcement message.',
    ignore: IgnoreCommand.Slash
})
export default class CrosspostCommand extends Command {
    async run(ctx: CommandContext){
        if(ctx.message) await ctx.message.crosspost();
        return ctx.write({ content: 'I have crossposted your announcement.'});
    }
};
```

:::tip
Seyfert supports subcommands within prefix commands.

## Responding to Prefix Commands

By default, when you use the `write` or `editOrReply` function, it will only send a message to the channel where the command was triggered. To make the command respond, you need to configure the `reply` suboption within the `command` option in the client options. This option is a callback whose first parameter is the [`CommandContext`](https://github.com/tiramisulabs/seyfert/blob/455ed12b0ebcb3ddf55bc8b3274b0ce904becc62/src/commands/applications/chatcontext.ts#L24) and expects a boolean to be returned: if `true`, it will reply to the command; if not, it will just send a message.

Here’s a detailed example of what your client will look like with all the modifications mentioned in this guide:

```ts showLineNumbers copy ins={9} wrap

import { Client } from 'seyfert';

const client = new Client({
    commands: {
        prefix: (msg) => {
            // here you can handle whatever prefixes you want depending on the message data.
            return ['!', '?', '.']
        },
        reply: (ctx) => true
    }
});

```

## Prefix Command Options

Just like with `application commands`, you can configure options for `prefix commands`. The only thing you need to do is declare them as you do with application commands. They are parsed with a regex that indicates that options will be split when followed by `-`. You can replace the parser with your own parser in the `argsParser` suboption within the `commands` options in the client options. This is a callback whose parameters are `content`, the message content, and `command`, the command that was executed, and expects an object whose keys are the options and values are the option values.

Here’s a short template showing how options work in prefix commands.

```txt hideLineNumbers title="Prefix Command Template"
!command -option value_option -option2 value_option2
```

Here you can see how we modify the previous command, but instead of crossposting the current message, we crosspost another message by getting its ID, which will be provided in the options.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { 
    Command,
    CommandContext,
    Declare,
    Options,
    createStringOption
} from 'seyfert';

const options = {
    id: createStringOption({
        description: 'The ID of the message we are going to crosspost',
        required: true
    })
};

@Declare({
    name: 'crosspost',
    description: 'Crosspost an announcement message.'
})
@Options(options)
export default class CrosspostCommand extends Command {
    async run(ctx: CommandContext<typeof options>){
        await ctx.client.messages.crosspost(ctx.options.id, ctx.channelId);
        return ctx.write({ content: 'I have crossposted your announcement.'});
    }
};
```

## Deferring Response with Prefix Commands

Just like with `application commands`, you can defer the response of a command. By default, if you use the `CommandContext.deferReply()` function, it will defer the response by showing a `Loading...` message. If we want the deferred response to be customized, we need to check the `commands` option in the client options again, as we need to create a callback for `deferReplyResponse` that expects the content to send during the deferral.

Here is an example of how we modify the client options and make the command response deferred using the previous example.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label='index.ts'>

```ts showLineNumbers copy ins={10} wrap

import { Client } from 'seyfert';

const client = new Client({
    commands: {
        prefix: (msg) => {
            // here you can handle whatever prefixes you want depending on the message data.
            return ['!', '?', '.']
        },
        reply: (ctx) => true,
        deferReplyResponse: (ctx) => ({ content: 'Please wait, processing your request...' })
    }
});

```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label='command.ts'>

```ts showLineNumbers copy

    Declare,
    Options,
    createStringOption

const options = {
    id: createStringOption({
        description: 'The ID of the message we are going to crosspost',
        required: true
    })
};

@Declare({
    name: 'crosspost',
    description: 'Crosspost an announcement message.'
})
@Options(options)
export default class CrosspostCommand extends Command {
    async run(ctx: CommandContext<typeof options>){
        await ctx.deferReply();
        await ctx.client.messages.crosspost(ctx.options.id, ctx.channelId);
        return ctx.write({ content: 'I have crossposted your announcement.'});
    }
};
```
