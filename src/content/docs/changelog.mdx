    title="V2.1.0 Changes"
    date="September 7, 2024"
  >
    **Fixed:**
    - Handle http status 429 correctly (ratelimited)
    - Could not disable cache with `.setServices` in a `WorkerClient`

    **Additions:**
    - `EntryPointInteraction`, `ButtonPointContext`, `EntryPointCommand`
    - Resharding for `Client` (enabled by default)
    - `AnyContext` type
    - `WORKER_SHARD_CONNECTED` event
    - `SUBSCRIPTION_DELETE`, `SUBSCRIPTION_UPDATE`, `SUBSCRIPTION_CREATE`
    - Now shards logs errors without need of debug mode
    - Workers now have a queue to spawn

    **Breaking Changes:**

    - Interface `AttachmentData` changed property `name` to `ilename`
    ```ts del={2} ins={3}
    interface AttachmentData {
      name: string;
      filename: string;
    }
    ```

    - Now WorkerClient does not send all events to parent (WorkerManager) by default, if you want to enable it, just
    ```ts
    new WorkerClient({
        sendPayloadToParent: true
    });
    ```

    - `disabledCache` option in `WorkerClient` is not longer there, use `setServices` instead

    With this version, we are proud to announce that seyfert now has 0 dependencies including a websocket client built from scratch.
  
    **Additions:**

    - **Handle commands**
    Now seyfert handle all commands across the same struct, if you use a custom argsParser o something check it, also, if you have a seyfert plugin or plan to make one, all seyfert structures are modifiable, so just point it where you want it to go.
    ```ts
    import { HandleCommand } from 'seyfert'

    client.setServices({ handleCommand: class extends HandleCommand { argsParser = yourParser() } })
    ```

    - **Transformers**
    Now seyfert allows you to transform discord data as you want,  seyfert will call it and use it in the whole library.
    ```ts
    import { Transformers } from 'seyfert';
    const storage = new Map();
    class MyPoll extends Poll {
        storage() {
            return storage.set(this.id, this);
        }
    }

    Transformers.Poll = (...args: ConstructorParameters<typeof MyPoll>) => new MyPoll(...args);

    declare module 'seyfert' {
        interface CustomStructures {
            Poll: MyPoll;
        }
    }
    ```

    - **Discord API**
    Now we support `Monetization`, `Polls (with builders)`, `Application Emojis`, `Get Role`, `Get voice states`, etc.

    **Little changes:**
    - Now disabledCaches options is a object
    - Some events cache bugs resolved
    - Fixed permissions bits resolved
